# Pattern_Project

## Branch structure
  * Each group member creates their own branch. 
  * Branch master only contains working version of the program

## Push/Pull Etiquette 
  * Commit your code to your branch as often as possible
  * Always pull from master before you start coding. If you forget to pull, run the following commands and steps (git bash only):

    1. git stash (to save local changes)
    2. git pull origin master (to pull from master)
    3. git stash apply (to apply local changes)
    4. resolve conflicts if applicable

3. When you are certain that your code works, push to your branch and make a pull request to merge your code to master
