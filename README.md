## Branch structure
  * Each group member creates their own branch. 
  * Branch master contains only working version of the program

## Push/Pull Etiquette 
  * Commit your code to your branch as often as possible
  * Always pull from master before you start coding. If you forget to pull, run the following commands and steps (git bash only):

    1. git stash (to save local changes)
    2. git pull origin master (to pull from master)
    3. git stash apply (to apply local changes)
    4. resolve conflicts if applicable

  * When you are certain that your code works, push to your branch and make a pull request to merge your code to master
